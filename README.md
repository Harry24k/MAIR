Adversarial training has become the de-facto standard method for improving the robustness of models against adversarial examples. However, during the writing of [our paper](https://openreview.net/forum?id=AGVBqJuL0T), we realized that there is no framework that integrates adversarial training methods. Therefore, to promote reproducibility and transparency in the field of deep learning, we have integrated the algorithms, codes, and pre-trained models. The goal of MAIR(Make your AI Robust) is to provide easy implementation and reproduction of adversarial training methods and make it easy to evaluate the adversarial robustness of deep learning models.
