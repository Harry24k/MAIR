> **TL;DR:** The goal of MAIR is to provide (1) easy implementation of adversarial training methods and (2) easy evaluation of the robustness of models.

Adversarial training has become the de-facto standard method for improving the robustness of models against adversarial examples. However, during the writing of [our paper](https://openreview.net/forum?id=AGVBqJuL0T), we realized that there is no framework integrating adversarial training methods. Therefore, to promote reproducibility and transparency in the field of deep learning, we integrated the algorithms, tools, and pre-trained models. The goal of MAIR (Make your AI Robust) is to provide an easy implementation and reproduction of adversarial training methods, making it easier to evaluate the adversarial robustness of deep learning models.
